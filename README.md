## Github_Workflow_File 
This repository contains a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing of Python APIs using Behave and generating Allure reports. The pipeline is configured to run on every push to the "main" branch, and it performs the following steps:

#### *Set up Python:*
Sets up the Python environment using the actions/setup-python action, specifying the Python version to use as 3.8.9.

#### *Install Dependencies:* 
Upgrades pip and installs the dependencies listed in the requirement.txt file using the pip command.

### **Usage**
#### To use the CI/CD workflow in your own project, follow these steps:

- Create a .github/workflows directory in the root of the GitHub repository, if it doesn't already exist.

- Copy the contents of the api.yml file from this repository into a new file with the same name (api.yml) in the .github/workflows directory of the repository.

- Commit and push the changes to the repository.

- The CI/CD workflow will now be automatically triggered to run on every push or pull request to the master branch of the repository.
